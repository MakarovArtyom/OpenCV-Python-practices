# OpenCV-Python-practices

Computer Vision techniques, implemented in Python, using OpenCV library.<br>
The code from Jupyter notebooks follows Udacity [Computer Vision nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) logic.<br>
More Computer Vision exercises can be found under Udacity CVND repo: https://github.com/udacity/CVND_Exercises
